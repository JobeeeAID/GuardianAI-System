# GuardianAI - AI-based Anomaly Detection for Reinforcing Network Security

GuardianAI is an AI-based anomaly detection system designed to reinforce
network security by identifying and preventing malicious activities in real-time.
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and intelligent system
that can analyze network traffic, detect anomalies, and take appropriate actions
to mitigate potential threats. GuardianAI aims to enhance network security,
prevent data breaches, and safeguard critical infrastructure by leveraging
advanced artificial intelligence techniques.
