# Hardware & Software requirements for implementing the system

Implementing GuardianAI, an AI-based anomaly detection system for network security, requires careful consideration of hardware and software requirements to ensure optimal performance and scalability. Here are my hardware and software requirements that I'll be using for implementing the system:

Hardware Requirements:

    Processing Power: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz   2.11 GHz .

    Memory (RAM): 16.0 GB .

    Storage: a 10 gb SSD available storage is fairly enough  .

    Network Interface Cards (NICs): High-performance NICs are crucial for efficiently capturing and analyzing network traffic in real-time.

    Graphics Card : Intel UHD graphics .

Software Requirements:

    Operating System: Windows 11 OS or Kali Linux(Provides tools for packet capture).

    Network Packet Capture Software: Software tools like tcpdump, Wireshark or CicFlowMeter for providing the .pcap file in csv format.

    Programming Language: Python ,shell scripting ...
    
    Machine Learning Libraries : numpy,pandas,sklearn,matplotlib,pickle,FastAPI...

    NoteBook IDE : Jupyter .

    Real-Time Data Processing: For real-time analysis, stream processing systems like Apache Kafka , Apache Spark Streaming can be employed.
